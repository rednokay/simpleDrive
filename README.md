# simpleDrive

## Important

This project is no longer developed as my Master’s Thesis moved towards Matlab/Simulink.

## The Project

This is an educational focused package for simulating and visualizing electric drives and will at some point hopefully include controller, converter and machine.

The project is currently very much work in progress and is being developed alongsite my Master's thesis.
